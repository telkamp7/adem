\title{Create a tsibble (time-series data) object from observed data and corresponding dates.}
\usage{
tsd(observed, time, time_interval = c("day", "week", "month"))
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{A numeric vector containing the observations.}

\item{time}{A date vector containing the corresponding dates.}

\item{time_interval}{A character vector specifying the time interval, choose between "day," "week," or "month."}
}
\value{
A tsibble object containing time, the observations, and the periodInYear.
}
\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}

This function takes observed data and the corresponding date vector and converts it into a tsibble object,
which is a time series data structure that can be used for time series analysis.

# Create a tsibble object from daily data
daily_tsd <- tsd(observed = c(10, 15, 20, 18), time = as.Date(c("2023-01-01", "2023-01-02", "2023-01-03", "2023-01-04")), time_interval = "day")

# Create a tsibble object from weekly data
weekly_tsd <- tsd(observed = c(100, 120, 130), time = as.Date(c("2023-01-01", "2023-01-08", "2023-01-15")), time_interval = "week")

# Create a tsibble object from monthly data
monthly_tsd <- tsd(observed = c(500, 520, 540), time = as.Date(c("2023-01-01", "2023-02-01", "2023-03-01")), time_interval = "month")
